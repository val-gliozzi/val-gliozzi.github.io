This was a quick gig I did for a small TV studio in South Florida. The TV show's premise was about a hacker who lived in his van and... hacked... stuff? That's all I've got. I had a shoestring budget on this one but as I was living on my bus at the time I had a pretty good idea of what the build would look like and the costs involved. Ultimately it was a pretty simple setup inside - a small single bed which lifted to reveal storage space inside, a small desk with multiple monitors and many electrical outlets, some LED lighting in the ceiling concealed underneath diffuser panels, hardwood laminate flooring, and some cheap carpet cut to shape and size and glued to walls to give a little bit of texture to the whole thing. While the setup is simple, anyone who has done a build like this can attest that it's never as simple as it seems on the outset. 

Everything is custom, you're constantly fighting with oddly shaped protrustions and everything you build makes the interior feel that much smaller. Still, the result was nice in the end and it was a mostly fun project to work on. The pictures were, unfortunately, an afterthought and hastily taken moments before I delivered to the client (in their parking lot, no less).
