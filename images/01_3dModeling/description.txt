Only in the last 2 years have I come to appreciate the true extent of the value a 3d printer provides. While most of the parts I produce are quite simple shapes used as small components of projects I am creating or parts borrowed from others who have done the work already, I have found the ability to make small parts on demand invaluable. With COVID keeping me away from the 3d printers I had become accustomed to using at New Lab, I purchased my first personal 3d printer in early 2020 and my second near the end of the year. While my 3d modeling ability is still in its infancy (I've found OpenSCAD to be the only modeling software which I find intuitive, but am also slowly learning SolidWorks) I seize every opportunity to model useful parts for my personal and home projects. Here are a few small parts I've designed which have engineering costs that greatly exceed their material value. However, the educational value makes it a more than worthwhile exercise. Over the last year I have learned a lot about FDM printing and the way various print settings affect the quality of the resultant print, and I've improved both in my 3d modeling ability and my ability to get strong, serviceable prints from my printers.
