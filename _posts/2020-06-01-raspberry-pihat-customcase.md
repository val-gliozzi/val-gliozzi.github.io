This is a simple HAT for a Raspberry Pi which integrates a proprietary module from a previous employer with a uBlox GPS module. I did the PCB design and build on these as well as designing custom case. This was originally inteded to be a development platform for the proprietary module, but the final devkit ended up being based on an STM32 nucleo board instead, so the project was ultimately unused.
