The CDU, or "central deployment unit" is a support product I was tasked to create to synergize with my company's (in development) flagship product. Our primary product is a small, handheld consumer device which can be paired with up to 11 other devices and then provides tracking, waypoint, and communication features. The CDU will charge and interface with 12 of these devices simultaneously
