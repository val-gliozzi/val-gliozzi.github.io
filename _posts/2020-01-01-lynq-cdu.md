The CDU, or "central deployment unit" is a support product I was tasked to create to synergize with a former company's flagship product. The primary product is a small, handheld consumer device which can be paired with up to 11 other devices and then provides tracking, waypoint, and communication features. The CDU charges and interface with 12 of these devices simultaneously, allowing the devices to be configured quickly and easily for rapid deployment.
