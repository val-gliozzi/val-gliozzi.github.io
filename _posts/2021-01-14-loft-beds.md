Over the years I've built at least a dozen loft beds either for myself or for friends... in NYC, this can be a near necessity to reclaim valuable space. I built this loft bed in 2016 directly into the room. Horizontal supports were mounted directly to the support studs of three walls in a bed-sized nook. A platform was built atop these horizontal supports and a ladder was built and installed as well. The construction is very simple, but helped increase reclaimed space and reduce cost (by eliminating support material), as well as accommodating a strange corner-shape and ensuring the bed remained level. Bonus panorama of a seperate loft built in a different, very small room for a different person in 2011. Panorama stitching processes have improved dramatically since!
