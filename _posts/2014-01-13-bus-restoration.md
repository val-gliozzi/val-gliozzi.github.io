This was one of my largest projects still to this date. A 35 foot AmTran/Ford school bus converted to run on vegetable oil with the interior built out to be a home. 

The vast majority of the interior was made from salvaged materials with some exceptions. Completion of the project demanded I learn many new skills while testing the ones I already had. This included the carpentry of the interior, wiring of the solar and interior electrical (both AC and DC), mechanical and plumbing work on the vegetable oil system to name a few. 

Additionally, the braking system unexpectedly needed a full overhaul, so I got to learn a lot about Lucas-Girling braking systems. Ultimately, I lived on the bus for over 3 years and traveled over 2000 miles on it in that time. I sold the bus in 2016 to a vacationing German family who then took her another thousand miles over several months. Last I heard, the bus was driven to Brazil where it is now someone's home.
