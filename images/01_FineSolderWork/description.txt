Much of my professional work requires delicate soldering work. Here is a small collection of pictures and videos demonstrating the type of fine soldering I can do. Included are hand-soldered 0201 component swaps, IC breakouts, fly wires, and hand placed components (including 0201, 0402 and QFN packages). There are also some hand populated boards which were solder pasted (some manually, some with a stencil) then flowed in an oven or with a hot air station in the gallery.
